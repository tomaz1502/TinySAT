# TinySAT

A tiny proof producing SAT solver.

## Road map:
  - [x] Parse DIMACS.
  - [x] Implement brute force.
  - [x] Implement DPLL.
  - [x] Tests
    + Add more tests. Also will need tests for unsat results.
  - [x] Produce proofs in the brute force search.
  - [ ] Produce proofs in DPLL.
  - [ ] Add more algorithms. Ideas: BDD, CDCL.
  - [ ] Conversion to CNF.
  - [ ] Perhaps a little web interface to input formulas, to learn something about web programming
  - [HOLD] (See Note.md) Create a functor to parametrize algo modules by the input format.
